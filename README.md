# Software-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room required a cross-platform game be developed and hosted in the cloud. They are a gaming company and the game was "Draw It or Lose It" in which you had to guess what was being drawn in a certain amount of time.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I was able to provide an in-depth, comprehensive analysis of all the options available to the client, and give a well-supported opinion on the best way to proceed.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Developing the code was made much easier by planning and reasoning out the different pieces of the program beforehand, best practices, etc.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would obtain realisitic pricing information on the cost of uptime on cloud platforms and also provide a cost schedule comparison of all the options as a supplement to the document itself.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I implemented the user's needs by employing best security and code execution practices, as well as memory management practices that supported the user experience in the best way possible.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I would design another application with the same starting point of learning the client's needs, the user's needs and analyzing the best platform to serve both in the best possible way.
